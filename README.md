```
Day by day trying not to fall behind
Sometimes it runs too fast for me
Wanna run away
"Hustle up! Move it, move it"
"Not today! Save it, save it"

Slip away hit me up with a wild ride (Gear up)
Racing to 60 tell me I look fine
Better watch out
"Hustle up! Move it, move it"
"Not today! Save it, save it"

I'm at my edge, system overload!

Dancing until overload, you should let it go
Dancing until overload, I don't wanna know
Dancing until overload, wait for tomorrow
Dancing until overload, I'll face it when I face it
Dancing until overload, all together now
If it blows up then let it
I'm too tired to care
Deadlinе is approaching
Dancing till the morning sunlight hits me

So many tasks are pilеd up to the sky
And now I'm stuck under all of this, I can't get out
Deadlines keep on marching towards me
I know I need to escape this place
Someone help!
"Hustle up! Move it, move it"
"Not today! Save it, save it"

I feel dizzy, jump into the beat

Dancing until overload, you should let it go
Dancing until overload, I don't wanna know
Dancing until overload, wait for tomorrow
Dancing until overload, I'll face it when I face it
Dancing until overload, too much for my head
Shake it out and break the night
Let the pulse rise up
No worries now, I'll dance along
If I can laugh my cares away today
Turn the volume up

Dancing until overload, you can't stop me now!
Dancing until overload, you should let it go
Dancing until overload, I don't wanna know
Dancing until overload, wait for tomorrow
Dancing until overload, I'll face it when I face it
Dancing until overload, all together now
Throw all the bad thoughts away
'Cause it will explode
Don't tell me the class tomorrow
I'm dancing till the morning again

Tomorrow I will study hard for real, but what?
Deadline was last night?
